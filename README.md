# PlayerReplace
Originally ["DCReplace Port"](https://github.com/DatPanDat/DCReplace) attempt that I've decided to try expend a bit. (probably will get worse)

#Feature
Replaces a player with a random spectator if they get disconnected. The replaced player with gain everything but the disconnected player status effects, but I might try that later.

Code quite literally taken from ["Cyanox62/DCReplace"](https://github.com/Cyanox62/DCReplace) two years old build and is quite literally my first project in C#, feel free to publicly shame me.

# Installation

**[EXILED](https://github.com/Exiled-Team/EXILED) must be installed for this to work.**

Place the "DCReplace.dll" file in your Plugins folder.
Set `disconnect_drop: false` in your gameplay config.
